Simple CMD Calculator using Mortgage equation

In order to calculate the monthly payment, we can rely on a relatively simple equation. The monthly payment equation can be represented as follows:
{\displaystyle M=P{\frac {r(1+r)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}-1}}}M=P{\frac  {r(1+r)^{{n}}}{(1+r)^{{n}}-1}}.

These variables represent the following inputs:
M is your monthly payment.
P is your principal.
r is your monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 12.
n is your number of payments (the number of months you will be paying the loan)[6]
